# Where and how artifacts are shared in ICSE and FSE papers

This page summarizes the locations and formats in which artifacts are shared in ICSE and FSE papers.

## Links shared in a single section/subsection

| Where the link appears           | \# ICSE | % ICSE | \# FSE | % FSE | \# ICSE + FSE | % ICSE + FSE |

## Links shared in multiple sections/subsections

| Where the link appears           | \# ICSE | % ICSE | \# FSE | % FSE | \# ICSE + FSE | % ICSE + FSE |

## How artifact links are shared within papers

| Format of the link | \# ICSE | % ICSE | \# FSE | % FSE | \# ICSE + FSE | % ICSE + FSE |
| ------------------ | ------: | -----: | -----: | ----: | ------------: | -----------: |
| Footnote           | 372     | 30.1%  | 251    | 29.9% | 623           | 30.0%        |

[^1]: A specific section or subsection named Data Availability or similar, such as Artifacts, Reproducibility, Reliability, Source code, Open Science, Open data, Verifiability, Replication Package, Artifact availability, Supplement, etc.

[^2]: Other sections refers to sections other than Introduction, Conclusion, or the dedicated sections [^1]. Examples include Threats to Validity, Study Design, Evaluation, Discussion, and even the Abstract.

[^3]: A labeled highlight, such as Data Availability (or similar), included within a general section, such as the Introduction, Conclusion, or one of the Other sections (e.g., Threats to Validity, Study Design, Evaluation, Discussion, or the Abstract), that is not explicitly dedicated to artifact sharing.
