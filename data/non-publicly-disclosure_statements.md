| [IP1881] | Indeed, our dataset of warnings from bug-finding tools is very hard-won, and we claim the public availability of our dataset is itself an important stepping-stone for future work on comparing the two and searching for synergies.<br><br>• Finally, we have (with a great deal of effort) created a multi-release repository of warnings from three tools, Jlint, pmd, and FindBugs, which we shall make publicly available for future research.<br><br>Ideally, this experiment should be repeated for more projects in more different languages, with other tools. In this case, since we making the defect data publicly available, it may help other researchers try other Java-based SBF tools.<br><br>In addition, AUCEC per se has been criticized for ignoring the cost of false negatives (missed defects [29]). We hope that our making this hard-won warnings & defect data available will encourage repetition of this trial with other measures.<br><br>We acknowledge these arguments, but claim our procedure defines a reasonable baseline for a longoverdue comparison; we hope that our dataset will enable other types of future analysis of the CBI problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | \- Future plans (—).                                                                                    | No             |

| [IP1931] | [...] we apply our framework on two open source systems (PetClinic and BroafLeaf commence) and one large-scale closed-source enterprise system (EA).<br><br>Broadleaf is a large open source e-commerce system that is used in many commercial companies worldwide for building online transaction platforms. EA supports a large number of users concurrently and is used by millions of users worldwide on a daily basis. We sought to use open source systems, in addition to the commercial system, so others can verify our findings and replicate our experiments on the open source systems, as we are not able to provide access to the EA.<br><br>Due to non-disclosure agreement (NDA), we cannot present the exact numbers of detected anti-patterns in EA. However, we can confirm that our framework is able to detect many of the existing and new performance problems in EA.<br><br>Figure 3 (EA is excluded due to NDA) shows that most software packages do not have instances of performance anti-patterns (e.g., more than 60% of the packages in Broadleaf have almost zero performance antipattern instance), and only about 15–35% of the packages in Broadleaf have anti-pattern instances.<br><br>We rank the packages by the number of performance anti-pattern instances (both excessive data and one-by-one processing together) contained in each package, and list the names in Table 5.

| [IP1940] | Due to privacy and confidentiality constraints of the field study, we cannot present the participants’ code. Instead, we demonstrate the usability problems using simplified versions of the participants’ pieces of code.<br><br>CodingSpectator captures snippets of code close to the program elements under refactoring. We found that this information was crucial for deriving usability problems. Nonetheless, recording such sensitive pieces of information raises privacy and confidentiality issues. We faced difficulty in recruiting participants because of these issues. There are several challenges in scaling our method to a large number of programmers. One challenge is to make the data collection transparent.

| [IP1576] | We consider the reliability of our conclusions to be very much dependent on the possibility to reproduce the results, which in turn is dependent on the clearness of the context information. The latter, however, is strongly limited by NDAs that too often prevent providing full disclosure of the contexts and even the project characteristics. To mitigate this threat, we anonymized the data as much as possible and disclosed all information possible within the limits of our non-disclosure agreements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \- Barriers (Confidentiality and privacy); <br> - Barriers (Agreements and legal rights).                     | Yes            |

| [IP10]   | Ethical Considerations: Our institution approved the use of this dataset because Play reviews are already public. In compliance with ethical training guidelines in our institution, we ensured that users’ privacy were respected. We thus carried out the following. First, all researchers have been trained in ethical user research prior to this study. Second, the dataset was preprocessed to remove user identifiers and app names before the researchers were given access. The only accompanying metadata beyond the review text, was the app’s category name and the publish timestamp. Third, access to this version of the dataset is limited to the authors of this paper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | \- Barriers (Confidentiality and privacy); <br> - Barriers (Agreements and legal rights).                     | No             |

Even though all issue discussions were public, we intentionally do not include direct links to them (1) to protect the parties involved and (2) because some of them have since been deleted. We will share our replication package with links only upon request for research purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | \- Barriers (Confidentiality and privacy); <br> - Limited access (Request required).                 | No             |

| [IP130]  | We conduct experiments on real-world alerts from two large commercial banks, A and B. As shown in Table 2, alerts of Bank A and Bank B have different characteristics. The definition of the alert in Bank A is not strictly standardized, thus there are thousands of alert types in its dataset. In Bank B, the definition of the alert is quite rigorous, thus Bank B has a much smaller number of alert types than Bank A. Due to the information privacy, we can only share the alert dataset of Bank B, which is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5336985, in which all sensitive information is anonymized.<br><br>We share the prototype of our approach, and an alert dataset of a large commercial bank, B, in which the confidential information and some sensitive alert types are removed.

| [IP147]  | The attacker was then able to list the buckets (which store resources as objects) on the server and download the contents of each bucket. The attack itself involved two main components. First, the attacker was able to gain authenticated access to an AWS IAM role [23]. Secondly, the role had broad access to S3 buckets due to a misconfigured policy. For confidentiality reasons, the misconfigured policy is not publicly available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | \- Barriers (Confidentiality and privacy).                                                               | Yes            |

For recruiting, we did not require official emails or company names, and allowed interviews with the camera off (after pre-screening with it on to verify identity). We employed a particularly high standard of confidentiality, including not releasing the interview text (which may contain identifying information admitting retaliation) without a data sharing agreement (e.g., via additional IRB certification, etc.). Finally, we obtained IRB permission to waive written informed consent (a paper trail linking the participant’s real name to the research) in favor of oral informed consent. These steps are pragmatically necessary (e.g., so people feel comfortable speaking truths), but, more importantly, are ethically necessary (to protect participants). | \- Barriers (Confidentiality and privacy); <br> - Limited access (Request required).                 | Yes            |
