### 2019B - FSE encourages authors to self-archive their pre- and post-prints in open, preserved repositories

> We encourage ESEC/FSE 2019 authors to self-archive their pre- and postprints in open, preserved repositories. This is legal and allowed by all major publishers including ACM (granted in the copyright transfer agreement), and it lets anybody in the world reach your paper. <br>
> If the authors of your paper wish to do this, we recommend:
> - Upon acceptance to ESEC/FSE 2019, revise your article according to the peers comments, generate a PDF version of it (postprint), and submit it to arXiv.org, which supports article versioning.
>
> Note that you are not allowed to self-archive the PDF of the published article (that is, the publisher proof or the Digital Library version) per policy of the ACM.
