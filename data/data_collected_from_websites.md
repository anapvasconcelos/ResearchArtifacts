# 2017 - 39th ICSE

### 2017A - Verifiability [^1] became an evaluation criterion for submitted papers (Technical)

> Research track submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria: […]
> - **Verifiability**: The evaluation of submissions will take into account to what extent sufficient information is available to support the full or partial independent verification or replication of the claimed contributions. The committee will consider independent verifiability an important factor that can significantly strengthen the value of a submission. Authors are strongly encouraged to explicitly discuss the verifiability of their contributions, including any links to relevant research artifacts, in a sub-section or paragraph titled "Verifiability".

# 2018 - 40th ICSE

### 2018A - An Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) is mentioned (SEIS)

> **What about additional information to support repeatability or verifiability of the reported results?** <br>
> ICSE’18 puts a strong emphasis on creation of quality artifacts and repeatability and verifiability of experiences reported in the papers. An artifact evaluation committee is put in place to review artifacts accompanying all accepted papers, without the need to conceal identity of the authors.

# 2021 - 43st ICSE

### 2021A - ICSE defines research artifact and adheres to Open Science policies (all tracks)


> ICSE 2021 has adopted an open science stance and introduced guidelines for authors (available at [https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2021/icse-2021-open-science-policies](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2021/icse-2021-open-science-policies)). The policies invite authors to provide all research artifacts for peer review, self-archive their pre- and post-prints, and archive artifacts as open data upon acceptance.

### 2023C - The artifacts availability needs to be declared in a specific paper section named Data Availability (+SEET and NIER)


#### - SEET

> *We therefore ask all authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section.* <br><br>
> *Authors who cannot disclose data should provide a short statement explaining the reasons why they cannot share the data in the Data Availability section of their paper, after the Conclusion section.*

## Previous event(s) that persisted or changed in 2023

### 2017A - Verifiability [^1] became an evaluation criterion for submitted papers (Technical)

> Each paper submitted to the Technical Track will be evaluated based on the following criteria: [...] <br>
> - **Verifiability and Transparency**: The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to understand how an innovation works; to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted; and how the paper supports independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions. **New this year: the artifacts attached to the paper (or hyperlinked to it) will be checked by at least one reviewer.**

### 2020B - The Artifact Evaluation Track at ICSE welcomes artifacts from papers from all five main ICSE tracks (+SEIP, SEET, SEIS, NIER)

> Authors of papers accepted to the Technical/SEIP/NIER/SEET/SEIS tracks can submit an artifact for the Artifacts Evaluated and Artifacts Available badges.

### 2020C - The Artifact Evaluation Track allows authors of any prior SE work, published at ICSE or elsewhere, to submit as candidate for Results Reproduced or Results Replicated badges

> Authors of any prior SE work (published at ICSE or elsewhere) are also invited to submit their work for the Results Validated badges.

### 2021B - The artifacts availability needs to be declared in a specific paper section named Data Availability (Technical)


#### - Technical

> Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked
> - to make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) – and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper, possibly in a section named "Data Availability" after the Conclusions;

### 2022A - The artifacts availability needs to be declared in a specific paper section named Data Availability (– SEIP and SEIS)

The information about the Data Availability section still does not appear in these tracks:

[^1]: Over the years, the **Verifiability** criterion (mentioned in Technical: 2017, 2019, 2020, and 2021; SEET since 2020 to 2023; and NIER 2023) has also been called **Replicability** (in Technical 2018), and **Verifiability and Transparency** (in Technical 2022 and 2023). In a general way they were always about the extent to which "sufficient information is available to support the full or partial independent verification or replication of the claimed contributions". (text from the [ICSE 2017 Technical track](https://icse2017.gatech.edu/?q=technical-research-cfp)).
