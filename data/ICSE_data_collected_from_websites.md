## 2017A - Verifiability is an evaluation criterion for submitted papers in the Technical track [^1]

### 2017

> Research track submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria: […]
> - **Verifiability**: The evaluation of submissions will take into account to what extent sufficient information is available to support the full or partial independent verification or replication of the claimed contributions. The committee will consider independent verifiability an important factor that can significantly strengthen the value of a submission. Authors are strongly encouraged to explicitly discuss the verifiability of their contributions, including any links to relevant research artifacts, in a sub-section or paragraph titled "Verifiability".

# Events that started in 2018

## 2018A - An Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) is mentioned - SEIS

### 2018

> **What about additional information to support repeatability or verifiability of the reported results?** <br>
> ICSE’18 puts a strong emphasis on creation of quality artifacts and repeatability and verifiability of experiences reported in the papers. An artifact evaluation committee is put in place to review artifacts accompanying all accepted papers, without the need to conceal identity of the authors.

## 2020D - Authors of accepted artifacts as Results Validated are invited to give lightning talks

### 2020

> Authors of any prior SE work (published at ICSE or elsewhere) are invited to submit an artifact to the ICSE Artifact Track for evaluation as a candidate replicated or reproduced artifact. If the artifact is accepted:
> - Authors will be invited to give lightning talks on this work at ICSE’20

## 2021E - ICSE encourages authors to self-archive their pre- and post-prints in open and preserved repositories

### 2021


#### Open Science Policies

> We encourage ICSE 2021 authors to self-archive their pre- and post-prints in open and preserved repositories. Self-archiving is legal and allowed by most publishers (granted in the copyright transfer agreement), and it will enable anybody in the world to reach papers barrier-free.
>
> Upon acceptance to ICSE 2021, we encourage authors to revise their article according to the peers’ comments, generate a PDF version of it (post-print), and submit it to arXiv.org or their institutional repository.
>
> Note: Authors are not allowed to self-archive the PDF of the published article as typeset by the publisher (a.k.a. “publisher proof,” “published paper,” “the digital library version”).

#### SEIS

> As you know, ICSE 2021 has embraced open science practices towards higher transparency of the scientific process and availability of research artifacts. With ICSE 2021 going virtual, more than ever we need to ensure access to archived preprints of accepted papers. To do so, authors from the Technical Track, JSEET, SEIP, SEIS, NIER, Demonstrations and Posters must make sure to:
> - Provide a supporting statement on the data/software/analysis scripts/.../artifact availability (or lack thereof, which should be accompanied by reasons for non-disclosure) in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section.
> - Self-archive your camera ready (NOT the typeset proof by IEEE).
>
> Authors from other tracks can also self-archive their camera ready although it is not mandatory for them. The policies (https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2021/icse-2021-open-science-policies) contain instructions and tutorials for this. In case of questions, do not hesitate to contact the open science chair Daniel Graziotin (daniel.graziotin@iste.uni-stuttgart.de).

# 2017 - 39th ICSE

## 2017A - Verifiability is an evaluation criterion for submitted papers in the Technical track [^1]

> Research track submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria: […]
> - **Verifiability**: The evaluation of submissions will take into account to what extent sufficient information is available to support the full or partial independent verification or replication of the claimed contributions. The committee will consider independent verifiability an important factor that can significantly strengthen the value of a submission. Authors are strongly encouraged to explicitly discuss the verifiability of their contributions, including any links to relevant research artifacts, in a sub-section or paragraph titled "Verifiability".

## 2021E - ICSE encourages authors to self-archive their pre- and post-prints in open and preserved repositories

### Open Science Policies

> We encourage ICSE 2021 authors to self-archive their pre- and post-prints in open and preserved repositories. Self-archiving is legal and allowed by most publishers (granted in the copyright transfer agreement), and it will enable anybody in the world to reach papers barrier-free.
>
> Upon acceptance to ICSE 2021, we encourage authors to revise their article according to the peers’ comments, generate a PDF version of it (post-print), and submit it to arXiv.org or their institutional repository.
>
> Note: Authors are not allowed to self-archive the PDF of the published article as typeset by the publisher (a.k.a. “publisher proof,” “published paper,” “the digital library version”).

### SEIS

> As you know, ICSE 2021 has embraced open science practices towards higher transparency of the scientific process and availability of research artifacts. With ICSE 2021 going virtual, more than ever we need to ensure access to archived preprints of accepted papers. To do so, authors from the Technical Track, JSEET, SEIP, SEIS, NIER, Demonstrations and Posters must make sure to:
> - Provide a supporting statement on the data/software/analysis scripts/.../artifact availability (or lack thereof, which should be accompanied by reasons for non-disclosure) in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section.
> - Self-archive your camera ready (NOT the typeset proof by IEEE).
>
> Authors from other tracks can also self-archive their camera ready although it is not mandatory for them. The policies (https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2021/icse-2021-open-science-policies) contain instructions and tutorials for this. In case of questions, do not hesitate to contact the open science chair Daniel Graziotin (daniel.graziotin@iste.uni-stuttgart.de).

Although PC members are not obligated to look at this material, we strongly encourage submitters to use supplementary material to provide access to anonymized code or data, whenever possible.

From 2022 the encougarement became a request, not only at Technical track, but also SEET and NIER tracks. See event [2022A](#2022a---authors-of-some-tracks-are-asked-to-make-their-data-available-to-the-program-committee-or-explain-why-this-is-not-possible-or-desirable).

### 2021D - Availability is an evaluation criterion for tool papers submitted - SEET

> Submissions will be evaluated based on their category: [...]
> - **Tool Papers** will be evaluated against these criteria: **Relevance, Significance, Maturity, Availability, Presentation**
> [...]
>
> The evaluation criteria for SEET 2023 papers are defined as follows: [...]
> - Availability: Whether the tool or technology is available online, open-sourced, or on a trial basis and the extent to which it can be evaluated by potential users.

### 2021E - ICSE encourages authors to self-archive their pre- and post-prints in open and preserved repositories


#### Open Science Policies

> We encourage ICSE 2023 authors to self-archive their pre- and post-prints in open and preserved repositories. Self-archiving is legal and allowed by most publishers (granted in the copyright transfer agreement), and it will enable anybody in the world to reach papers barrier-free.
>
> Upon acceptance to ICSE 2023, we encourage authors to revise their article according to the peers’ comments, generate a PDF version of it (post-print), and submit it to arXiv.org or their institutional repository.
>
> Note: Authors are not allowed to self-archive the PDF of the published article as typeset by the publisher (a.k.a. “publisher proof,” “published paper,” “the digital library version”).

[^1]: Over the years, the **Verifiability** criterion (mentioned in Technical: 2017, 2019, 2020, and 2021; SEET since 2020 to 2023; and NIER 2023) has also been called **Replicability** (in Technical 2018), and **Verifiability and Transparency** (in Technical 2022 and 2023). In a general way they were always about the extent to which "sufficient information is available to support the full or partial independent verification or replication of the claimed contributions". (text from the [ICSE 2017 Technical track](https://icse2017.gatech.edu/?q=technical-research-cfp)).
